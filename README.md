# Group15 mRNA Sequence Analysis
This repository contains Python scripts developed for the IBI1 Semester 2 (2024–25) group project.
The project involves the analysis of mRNA sequences through a series of tasks, including identifying codon usage patterns, analyzing amino acid frequencies, and creating a custom biologically meaningful function.

# Project Structure
task_1.py – Identify the most frequent trinucleotide codon
task_2.py – Compute the encoded amino acid for the most frequent nucleotide
task_3.py – Visualize the frequency distribution of amino acids
task_4.py – Find reverse complements
test.py – Unit tests to check the correctness of all task modules

# Team Contributions
-Lin Peiyu
Developed code for task_1, task_2, and task_3
Focused on implementing codon and amino acid analysis features
-Liu Zheng
Implemented task_4, which includes an additional function providing meaningful biological insights
-Liu Zhuohan
Responsible for writing and executing testing code to ensure that all scripts run correctly and reliably
-Zeng Yanbo
Focused on verifying code functionality and optimizing performance and readability across all tasks

# Keys
All input mRNA sequences are assumed to be in-frame, starting with the start codon AUG Functions are designed to be biologically meaningful and efficient Please refer to the project poster for a detailed explanation of the approach and results
